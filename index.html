                    <div class="sub-title">
                        Started learning C Programming after finishing 10<sup>th</sup> Grade (Matriculation). Later at <sup>+</sup>2 (Computer Science) Started learning C++, HTML, JS, MySQL &amp; PHP. After that while I was studying Degree (B.Sc Computer Science), I learned CSS, JS/ES6. After that I have completed an Internship on Jr. Android Developer from TCS. Meanwhile I have learned to build a complete Project from scratch in PHP & MySQL. After that, while I was studying Post Graduation
                        (MCA), I learned Git, Python and started learning other technologies like Node.js, Express.js (MVC), MongoDB, Angular etc. on my own from free internet resources.

                    <div class="sub-title">
                        I got interested in the Web Technologies due to the simplicity to use graphics and attractive UI designs. Web technologies had a highly customizable User Interface along with animations, Canvas (Graphics), and high user event interactions. I started learning PHP because it was a basic requirement in Higher Secondary School and College, but when I realized that PHP has in fact some security issues even though it can be fixed by using secure functions, I though about
                        switching to a new programming language. At that time I was interested in the ES6 feature of JS and later I realized that there was a Server Side JS version which was built on Chrome's V8 Engine, so I switched to Node.js

                    <div class="title">Web Designing</div>
                    <div class="sub-title">
                        As mentioned above, I was inspired by attractive UI designs and high customizability of Web technologies. So I practiced to make attractive UI using CSS. But still I wasn't interested in Bootstrap the UI template for web pages which makes web pages responsive (Change UI/layout according to screen size), all pages made with bootstrap looked almost the same and spoiled the creativity. That's when I learned about there were @media queries which is built in into CSS to make
                        the web responsive without any library or templates.

                    <div class="sub-title">
                        When I first participated in a competitive programming I failed, then again another failure on second attempt, But I didn't stop trying like some others, I started practicing whenever I had free time and in next competition I got 3<sup>rd</sup> price and tried again in many other colleges and won 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> prices for Coding as well as Web designing. I also started working on online competitive programming sites like Hackerrank ( my profile :
                        <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/27pixels" target="_blank">27pixels</a> ), CodeWars ( my profile : <a href="https://www.codewars.com/users/27px" target="_blank">27px</a> )

                        I had to visit a company to complete my mini project in degree (Under Graduation), after that I learned PHP by reffering the code and made a complete File Manager with Interactive UI, AppStore for html based apps, HTML IDE for building apps, and some html based apps within the file Manager like games, puzzles, dictionaries etc. MCA mini project was a Placement Prediction System, a Machine Learning Project using Node.js, Brain.js, Express.js, MongoDB. MCA Main Project was
                        a GUI SSH and Local File Browser that can be run as a desktop application. Built using Node.js Electron.js, Angular
